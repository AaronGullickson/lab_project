This directory should contain any raw data that you receive from elsewhere. The tract-level data from the US census is already located here, but you will need to add in the raw individual-level data from your IPUMS extract.

By maintaining separate input and output directories for your data, you can easily distinguish the raw original data from analytical datasets that you have constructed.
